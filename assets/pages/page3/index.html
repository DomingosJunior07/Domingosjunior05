        <p>I developed a complete contact manager using pure JavaScript, with all the essential features for contact management. The application allows users to add new contacts, edit existing information, and remove entries when necessary.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of this project is the use of local storage through the browser's <code>localStorage</code>, which keeps data persistent even after the application is closed. I implemented a robust validation system that checks the fields in real-time, ensuring the quality of the entered data.</p>

<p>The interface was carefully designed to be intuitive and responsive, adapting perfectly to different screen sizes. I added advanced features such as instant search, which filters contacts as the user types, and automatic alphabetical sorting.</p>

<p>The code follows best development practices, with a clear separation of concerns and well-documented functions. I used DOM events to create an interactive experience, with visual feedback for all user actions.</p>
