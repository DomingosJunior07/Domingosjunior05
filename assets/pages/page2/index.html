        <p>I developed a complete school management system using C# and Microsoft Access as the database. The application was created to automate the student enrollment process and manage school passes, replacing the previous manual system.</p>

        <p>The system includes integrated modules for student registration, document issuance, enrollment control, and school pass generation. I implemented a layered architecture following the MVC pattern, clearly separating business logic, data access, and user interface.</p>
        
        <p>For the database, I used Microsoft Access with optimized relational tables and complex queries to ensure performance even with a large volume of data. I created stored procedures for the most critical operations and implemented automatic data backups.</p>
        
        <p>The user interface was developed using Windows Forms with an intuitive design and customized reports using Crystal Reports. The system includes advanced features such as PDF document generation, barcode scanner integration for school passes, and statistics generation.</p>
        
        <p>I implemented robust security measures including access control by user roles, encryption of sensitive data, and audit logging for all critical operations. The system reduced manual processing time by 80% and eliminated typing errors in official documents.</p>
