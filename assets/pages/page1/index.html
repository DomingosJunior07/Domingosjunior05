        <p><span class="bold">My portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is my digital professional showcase.</span> It presents my best work, skills, and experiences in an interactive and visually appealing way. This is my online business card, where I express my creativity and technical competence.</p>

<p><span class="bold">I built the base structure of the portfolio using HTML</span>, carefully organizing each section to ensure intuitive navigation. From the header with my name and specialization to the detailed project pages, every element was designed to showcase my work in the best possible way.</p>

<p><span class="bold">With CSS, I brought personality and life to my portfolio.</span> I carefully selected the colors, fonts, and spacing that represent my personal brand. I used modern techniques such as Flexbox and Grid to ensure my site looks perfect on any device, from mobile to desktop. I also added small animations and transitions to make the experience more enjoyable.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JavaScript was essential to make my portfolio truly interactive.</span> I implemented features such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A responsive menu that adapts to small screens</li>
    <li>Filters to organize my projects by category</li>
    <li>Smooth scrolling effects between sections</li>
    <li>A contact form that validates data before submission</li>
    <li>A toggle option for light and dark mode</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="bold">My portfolio reflects who I am as a professional.</span> It shows not only what I do, but how I think and solve problems. Every detail was carefully planned to demonstrate both my technical skills and creative perspective.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Updating my portfolio is an ongoing process.</span> Whenever I complete a new relevant project or learn a new skill, I make sure to add it to the site. This way, it always stays up to date with my latest work and professional growth.</p>

<p><span class="bold">This portfolio has been fundamental to my career.</span> It has already helped me land amazing opportunities, as it allows clients and employers to see the quality of my work in action. More than just a simple collection of projects, it tells the story of my professional journey.</p>
